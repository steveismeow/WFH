"Yesterday we discussed your history with the company. {a} Today, I'd like to dig into your work with the Marketing team."

Lily "Sounds good.", playAnim(Happy)

You "What do you believe creates a meaningful brand identity?", playAnim(Neutral)

Lily "This may sound a bit contrived, {a} but I think you have to know who your company is in order to design a functional and memorable brand identity."

You "Can you elaborate on that?"

Lily "Basically my job is to make a digital simulacrum."

You "simulacrum?"

Lily "Or a digital representation of the company."

"Without being able to make that representation seem 'real', our marketing and social media will seem fake and our engagement would decrease"

You "And how exactly do you accomplish that?"

Lily "In my experience it's a lot of  iteration."

"You try something, you test it, and then make changes from there."

"At my last company, it took almost 2 years to achieve the brand identity we wanted.", next
