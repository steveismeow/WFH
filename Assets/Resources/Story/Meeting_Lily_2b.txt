Lily "Thank you." playAnim(Happy)

You "Have you held a management role in previous positions?"

Lily "Ah, definitely not in this large of a company."

"But I'm ever confident that what I lack in experience I've more than made up for in my work ethic."

You "I can see that."

"Well that's about our time today."

Lily "Thank you, I do try very hard."

"Are we still on for a meeting tomorrow?"

You "Yes. See you tomorrow."
